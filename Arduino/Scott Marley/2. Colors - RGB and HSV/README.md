# Episode 2 - Colors RGB and HSV
FastLED has a very powerful HSV system for dealing with colors, but new users often stick with RGB as it's what they know. Here I explain the HSV color system and why you probably want to use it over RGB. Topics covered in this episode include:
- Creating RGB colors
- Understanding and using the HSV color system
- Adjusting the overall strip brightness
- LED color correction
- Color temperature correction
